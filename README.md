# Speech Prediction
This demo leverages the fantastic R interface to Keras (https://keras.rstudio.com/) to generate predictive text. The predictive text is generated for Nietzche (https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/examples/lstm_text_generation.html) and Donald Trump (https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/trump-speeches). 

## Shiny
Shiny app is used to display and voice over the predicted text.
